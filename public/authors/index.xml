      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tess Hooper is a second-year masterâ€™s student at the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp;amp; Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. For her graduate thesis group project, Tess is conducting spatial analyses to assess the ecological impacts of environmental education and research on nature preserves. Specializing in Conservation Planning with a focus in Strategic Environmental Communications &amp;amp; Media, Tess is interested in the tradeoffs between public access to nature and the ecological and environmental justice implications surrounding access to public and private lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to attending the Bren School, Tess spent five years in environmental and science education, most recently teaching middle school Science and STEM in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Upon graduating from the Bren School, Tess plans to pursue a career in environmental planning, particularly in regards to managing human-environment interactions in the Los Angeles area.&lt;/p&gt;
